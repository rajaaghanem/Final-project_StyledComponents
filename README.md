# Middle-Project_food-workshops

A react project where I built for adding style to React components in an easy way.

## About the project

Over 10ten days we had to create our own React app, I did it by using a couple of things:

- APIs
- React Router
- Use Hooks
- MongoDB
- Express
- And more!

## The site :

### User can styled his own components and then copy the code directly to his project.
